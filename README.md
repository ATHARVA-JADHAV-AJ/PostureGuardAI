# 🛡️ PostureGuardAI: The Kinetic Intelligence Module

> **"Teaching the new gen how to think with physics, and the AI how to watch with precision."**

**PostureGuardAI** is a high-sensitivity, real-time ergonomics engine built for those who live in the terminal. Developed as a core module of **Project Noisy Boy**, this isn't just a slouch tracker—it’s a digital twin surveillance system that monitors skeletal alignment with 8mm micro-movement precision.

## 🚀 The GOAT Features

* **Hyper-Sensitive Micro-Movement Matrix**: Detects 8mm shifts in posture using a custom physics-based threshold.
* **Terminal VENN Data Collector**: Integrated 'g' (Good) and 'b' (Bad) key-logging for rapid dataset expansion.
* **Dual-Layer Notification System**: Uses OG Windows `ctypes` popups to break "stillness stagnation" without needing an internet connection.
* **AGI Framework**: Part of the broader "Friday Way" philosophy, moving toward true kinetic awareness.
* **Background Optimization**: Designed to run light on resources, with future targets for **Intel OpenVINO** acceleration.
